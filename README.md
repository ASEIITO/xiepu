# XiEPU index
## Summary
This repository offers an economic policy uncertainty (EPU) dataset derived from textual data related to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In our paper (Ito, Lim, and Zhang 2023), we introduced an EPU index named XiEPU. This index is constructed using a text dataset comprising speeches and reports by the Chinese President from November 2012 to December 2021.

## Background
 Led by [Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/4/1593/2468873), the EPUs have been widely used by academics as well as financial institutions including central banks. As of January 2023 [the EPU website](https://www.policyuncertainty.com/) lists a global index, 28 country indices, and other related indicators.
 
 
## Our method and interpretation
We employed a dictionary method by using keywords of (a) Economic keywords and (c) Uncertain keywords in table below. (b) Policy keywords are not used in our method as the Xi Jinping text inevitably contains policy implications. For more details, please see Ito, Lim, and Zhang (2023).

While XiEPU contains similar aspects of EPU, it also has a qualitatively distict feature compare to conventional EPUs. In our paper, we interpret XiEPU as follows:
> We argue that XiEPU is a proxy index of President Xi and his administration’s perceptions of economic uncertainty and a signal for related uncertainties, containing important information regarding mid-long-term risks and policy directions facing Chinese firms in particular.
